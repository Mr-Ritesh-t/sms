This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

2.  **Copy Files**: Copy all the project files from this editor to a new folder on your local machine, making sure to maintain the same file and folder structure.

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate into your project's root folder, and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**: Once the installation is complete, start the Next.js development server by running:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **View Your App**: Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002). You should see your application running!

You can now edit the files locally, and the development server will automatically reload the app with your changes.
