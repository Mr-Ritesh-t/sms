/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a security model with a clear separation
 * between private user data and shared application data. It prioritizes strict
 * authorization while allowing flexibility in data structure for rapid prototyping.
 * User-specific data is governed by a strict ownership model, while general
 * school-related data is readable by any authenticated user. Sensitive data like
 * grades is locked down by default pending a more detailed authorization schema.
 *
 * Data Structure: The database is organized into several top-level collections:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile information, including roles.
 * - /students/{studentId}: A directory of all students in the system.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: A directory of all teachers in the system.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: A catalog of all available courses.
 * - /grades/{gradeId}: Contains sensitive grade information for students.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access is granted explicitly.
 * - Role-Based Writes: Write access to core data collections (students, teachers, courses)
 *   is restricted to users with an 'admin' role, defined in their /users/{userId} document.
 * - Prototyping-Friendly Reads: To support UI development, any authenticated user can
 *   currently read the main data collections. This should be tightened in the future.
 * - Sensitive Data Lockdown: The /grades collection is completely locked. The
 *   current data model does not contain the necessary information (e.g., a link
 *   between a student and a user's auth ID) to write secure authorization rules.
